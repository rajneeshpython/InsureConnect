# ðŸ“Œ Case Study: InsureConnect
*(A Digital Insurance Marketplace â€“ inspired by RenewBuy)*

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Application Goal
A digital insurance marketplace where users (customers & agents) can:
- Compare Motor, Health, and Life insurance policies  
- View multiple quotes from different insurers  
- Purchase policies seamlessly  
- Manage renewals and claims assistance  

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python + Django REST Framework (APIs)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (structured data)  
- **Caching**: Redis (fast insurer responses / session store)  
- **Queue/Async**: Celery + RabbitMQ/Kafka (for heavy tasks like PDF generation, email/SMS)  
- **Authentication**: JWT + OAuth (agents, customers)  
- **Deployment**: Docker + AWS ECS (scalable microservices style)  
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch + ELK stack  

---

## ðŸ“¦ Core Modules
### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- Customer registration/login  
- Agent login (separate role)  
- JWT token-based authentication  

### 2. Insurance Modules
- **Motor Insurance**: Vehicle details â†’ Quotes â†’ Compare â†’ Purchase â†’ Policy PDF  
- **Health Insurance**: Family details â†’ Quotes â†’ Compare â†’ Purchase â†’ Policy PDF  
- **Life Insurance**: Term plan details â†’ Quotes â†’ Compare â†’ Purchase â†’ Policy PDF  

### 3. Insurer Integrations (Adapter Pattern)
- Different insurer APIs (HDFC, ICICI, Bajaj, etc.) return different formats  
- Design a common adapter interface to normalize responses  
- Use mock APIs for testing  

### 4. Quote Engine
- Takes customer input  
- Calls all insurer adapters in parallel  
- Aggregates & normalizes results  
- Returns comparable quotes  

### 5. Purchase & Policy Issuance
- Customer selects a plan  
- Make insurer API call (mocked)  
- Generate policy document (PDF)  
- Notify via email/SMS  

### 6. Renewals & Reminders
- Store expiry date in DB  
- Send reminders (async job with Celery)  

### 7. Admin & Analytics Dashboard
- List policies sold (by insurer, premium, type)  
- Track failed API calls  
- Export reports

## ðŸ“Š Real-Time Use Cases
### Car Insurance
- Customer enters car number + details  
- Gets quotes from HDFC Ergo, ICICI Lombard, Bajaj Allianz  
- Compares premiums  
- Buys policy â†’ PDF generated â†’ Email sent  

### Health Insurance (via Agent)
- Agent logs in  
- Helps customer enter details (age, family members)  
- Shows multiple insurer quotes (Star Health, Max Bupa, Care)  
- Customer selects plan  
- Policy purchased â†’ Commission assigned to agent  

### Life Insurance
- Customer enters details (income, age, smoker/non-smoker)  
- Fetches quotes (HDFC Life, ICICI Prudential, PNB MetLife)  
- Selects best plan  
- Buys â†’ policy stored in DB  

### Renewal Reminder
- Motor insurance expiring in 7 days  
- Background task checks expiry  
- Sends automated email + SMS
